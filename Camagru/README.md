TO DO: Correct the display bug when you upload a picture after choosing the sticker then select a diffrent sticker, and the first one is stile displayed underneath.
Change the identity check so the user ID is used instead of the username.
Correct the typo on the link in the banner in the "change settings" page.
Add a check for the username so that it cannot be longer than 50 chars, otherwise it doesn't save properly in the database.
